# Creating Transitions with Vanilla JS

_*Be warned, this discussion question may be scary to some viewers*_

jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides some handy, shorthand solutions to DOM manipulation.  While it's useful and important to understand how to use jQuery, all of things you can do in jQuery can be done using just vanilla JavaScript.  For today's discussion question, you have been given a jQuery solution that creates an event listener then uses a jQuery transition to fade out a div.

As a group, clone down this repo, and run the existing code to see how it works.  Your task is to comment out the jQuery solution and write your own solution using just JS DOM Manipulation (*Hint: getting elements by id and adding and event listener*) and then setting up an interval to smoothly change the CSS.

Can you save Abraham Lincoln using just JavaScript?
